### 1. Filter Meals  
Users can filter meals based on the following categories:
- **Gluten Free**
- **Lactose Free**
- **Vegan**
- **Vegetarian**

### 2. Favorite Meals  
Users can mark meals as their **favorites**, and those meals will be saved and easily accessible on a dedicated **Favorites Page**.




### Packages
- **flutter_riverpod:**  
  Riverpod is used to manage the application's state and provides a predictable way to handle changes such as filtering meals and managing favorite meals. Implemented in favorite meals, filter meals based on category, meals data, and the navigation bar. 
  
- **google_fonts:**  
  This package allows you to use fonts from Google Fonts in your Flutter app easily. It supports fetching and using fonts dynamically and ensures that text looks great with minimal effort by avoiding manual font asset management.

- **transparent_image:**
